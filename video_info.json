The vehicle, barely discernible in the darkness, disappears down the road, its headlights illuminating a section of the brick wall and the open gate.The camera returns to its original position, holding the street and field in view for a few moments.

Once more, the vehicle, hidden by the night, drives past, its headlights briefly brightening the scene.The camera returns to its initial position, and a faint beeping sound is audible.
