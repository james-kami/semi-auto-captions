        "description": "This is a video captured by a security camera at night. The image is in black and white. The camera is mounted above a door leading to a backyard. The camera is facing the yard. The yard is dark and overgrown with weeds.  There is a large plant in the middle of the frame that looks like a weed plant. In the bottom right corner, there is a blurry outline of a person or animal that is walking away from the camera. The video ends before the person or animal is fully in view.  There is a digital time and date stamp in the top left corner of the screen. The time stamp shows the date as 05/28/2024 and the time as 02:25:07.  There is also a \"kami\" logo in the bottom left corner.  At the end of the video, a sound of a bird chirping can be heard.  At 0:36, a bird chirps 6 times in a row. ",
