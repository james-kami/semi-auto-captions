He explains that humans have been communicating for millions of years, from cave drawings to text messages and interpretive dance. The scene then cuts to a teacher in a classroom who is demonstrating some interpretive dance.  The young man continues speaking, stating that almost half of teens have been affected by mental illness. He then makes the point that we should be using all forms of communication to break down stigmas and save lives. The video ends with a call to action: to talk, draw, text, dance, and communicate \"human to human.\" It encourages viewers to visit the website bringchangetomind.org.  The overall theme of the video is promoting mental health awareness and communication. ",
