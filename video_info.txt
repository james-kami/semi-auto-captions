Description: The video is a short clip from a home security camera.  It shows the inside of a kitchen and a hallway with a door at the end.  On the counter in the kitchen is a variety of grocery bags and a few items, including a bottle of wine, a lime, and three apples.  In the hallway, a black vacuum cleaner is sitting by a chair.  On the floor, there is a bowl of pet food.  A young blonde woman walks into the kitchen and grabs one of the grocery bags.  She is wearing a black t-shirt.  She heads towards the hallway and opens the door.  Two small dogs, one white and one brown, are in the hallway running around and playing, and the blonde woman walks out of the kitchen after opening the door, but it is unclear where she is going. 
The white dog then walks back into the kitchen and stands by the island for a while, looking around.  The brown dog remains in the hallway out of view for a while, but then eventually walks back into the kitchen and stands by the island as well.  The white dog starts barking softly at the brown dog, and the brown dog then moves away from the island, but it still remains in the kitchen.  The video ends. 
The security camera does not capture audio, and there is no dialogue or music in the clip.  It is just a simple recording of the activity in the kitchen and hallway. 
Final Description: positive

Description: The video is a static shot of a wooden fence. The wood is weathered and gray, with some darker streaks running vertically. The camera is positioned so that the fence appears to be blurry, almost as if it is out of focus. The video is accompanied by an audio clip of what sounds like birds chirping and rustling leaves.
