Description: The video shows a static shot of a lawnmower in the back yard of a house. The camera is positioned at an elevated angle on the wooden back porch. The lawnmower is in the lower right of the screen, next to a wheelbarrow and some gardening tools. A colorful doormat and a section of wooden railing are in the foreground. The time and date are displayed in the upper left corner.  The lawnmower appears to be running, and you can hear it faintly. It seems like there is a bird chirping in the background. 
Final Description: negative
